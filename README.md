# Chaos Ray Tracing course repo

Minimalistic C++ ray tracer developed during the Chaos Ray Tracing course 2023. It's a software renderer that does not depend on the GPU or any graphics API or windowing libs. It only relies on rapidjson lib for parsing the input scene description and stb_image to write the generated pixel data.
